        PiggyVest is the first online “Savings & Investment” app in West Africa. It first launched as “Piggybank.ng” on
        the 7th of January 2016 as a savings-only platform.<br><br>

        For 3 years, we offered ONLY savings to our users. Then in April of 2019 Piggybank.ng rebranded to “PiggyVest”
        and then began to offer DIRECT investments opportunities to users in addition to savings.
        <br>
        <br>
        4 years on, We have continued to deliver excellent service to our 350,000 users and counting, by helping them
        manage their finances in a very simple way. Combined, PiggyVest users save & invest billions of Naira every
        month that they would probably be tempted to badly spend.
        <br>
        <br>
        PiggyVest is on a mission 'to give everyone the power to better manage & grow their own finances’, and we intend
        to be the best at this.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you for choosing PiggyVest. ❤️
